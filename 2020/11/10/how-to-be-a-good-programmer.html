  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I’ve spent a lot of time roaming around programming forums
and working with other developers. The way that many
developers think about their code is in terms of
objectives. How can I make this code be better? How can
I make this code faster? How can I make it more readable?
Don’t get me wrong - these are all good questions to ask.
It is a <strong>good</strong> thing to be concerned with objectives that
your code fulfills.</p>

<p>The issue with problematic code is that the problem extends
beyond just the code itself – those problems often stem
from the programmer. The way that a programmer thinks and
approaches problems drastically change the code they
produce.</p>

<p>It is really easy to teach people how to fix bad code. It
is much more difficult to teach them how to become a Good
Programmer, to the point that most people don’t even
bother. I don’t mean this as an insult to novice
developers - in many ways, this is more of a problem with
people answering questions on programming forums than
anyone else. We are enamored with the age-old adage: give a
man a fish, feed him for a day and all that. But the best
solution we’ve come up with is telling people to “Look it
up.” “Look at the documentation.” “Read this.” “Read that.”</p>

<p>Again, don’t get me wrong, it is a <em>good</em> thing to be
helpful. It is <em>good</em> to give resources and to refer people
who otherwise would not know how to approach
problem-solving to search engines and the documentation.</p>

<p>However, this is a surface-level solution to a deeper
problem. Novice developers don’t know how to be Good
Programmers.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-a-good-programmer">What is a Good Programmer?</h1>

<p>Allow me to preface by describing what it means to <em>not</em> be
a Good Programmer.</p>

<p><em>Not</em> being a Good Programmer does not mean you are a Bad
Programmer. But it can.</p>

<p>A Bad Programmer is unwilling to learn. A Bad Programmer is
not open to new ideas. A Bad Programmer is resistant to
critique.</p>

<p>If you are a Bad Programmer, you can safely close your
browser tab. I can’t help you.</p>

<p>However, not all those who are <em>not</em> Good Programmers are
Bad Programmers. Novices and intermediate developers can
become Good Programmers. Even accomplished career software
engineers can become Good Programmers if they have not
already.</p>

<p>Being a Good Programmer means that you are an effective
thinker. It means you are an effective problem-solver. To
be a successful developer, you should strive to be a Good
Programmer.</p>

<h1 id="why-is-it-important-to-be-a-good-programmer">Why is it important to be a Good Programmer?</h1>

<p>A Good Programmer writes better code.</p>

<p>A Good Programmer writes fast code.</p>

<p>A Good Programmer writes less buggy code.</p>

<p>A Good Programmer is more employable.</p>

<p>A Good Programmer enjoys their work.</p>

<h1 id="what-makes-a-good-programmer">What makes a Good Programmer?</h1>

<p>Every item in this list is connected, in more ways than
one.</p>

<h4 id="1-a-good-programmer-does-not-follow-a-list-of-rules">1. A Good Programmer does not follow a list of rules</h4>

<p>You do not become a Good Programmer by using a checklist to
make sure you are doing every single action.</p>

<h4 id="2-a-good-programmer-understands-context">2. A Good Programmer understands context</h4>

<p>You do not become a Good Programmer if you constantly break
rules that you are meant to follow.</p>

<p>This is not a list of rules. This is a list of precepts.
These are things that are actions that are common amongst
Good Programmers. A Good Programmer does not refer to this
list every time they encounter a problem.</p>

<h4 id="3-a-good-programmer-uses-rationale">3. A Good Programmer uses rationale</h4>

<p>Understanding how things work and why they work improves
your intution of why it is done.</p>

<p>If you understand why these precepts exist, you do not need
to memorize them. You have the intuition that this is
correct way to approach problem-solving.</p>

<h4 id="4-a-good-programmer-understands-nuance">4. A Good Programmer understands nuance</h4>

<p>Every rule or solution has an exception.</p>

<p>Many problems are more detailed than they initially appear.
It is important to determine whether or not precepts can be
applied in each scenario.</p>

<h4 id="5-a-good-programmer-follows-good-practices">5. A Good Programmer follows good practices</h4>

<p>You should remember good practices because they are robust
ways to solve problems in most cases.</p>

<p>Good practices exist because Good Programmers understand
the rationale for using them. Departing from good practices
<em>requires</em> you to justify that decision. It is harder to
justify this departure than to simply use the default
approach.</p>

<h4 id="6-a-good-programmer-communicates-intent">6. A Good Programmer communicates intent</h4>

<p>Code should communicate what it is <em>meant</em> to do.</p>

<p>Expressive code is easier to read and review. Expressive
code makes it harder to write buggy code.</p>

<h4 id="7-a-good-programmer-understands-bugs">7. A Good Programmer understands bugs</h4>

<p>It is important to understand <em>why</em> the bug arose.</p>

<p>As the adage goes, debugging is the process of removing
bugs from the code. Therefore, programming is the process
of putting them in.</p>

<p>You are the source of all bugs. Therefore, you should
understand what lead to <em>you</em> to write buggy code.</p>

<h4 id="8-a-good-programmer-notices-patterns">8. A Good Programmer notices patterns</h4>

<p>Patterns are nearly never the result of pure coincidence.</p>

<p>There is a reason why patterns exist. It is easier to read
code if you think about it in terms of patterns. Noticing
patterns can help diagnose bugs.</p>

<h4 id="9-a-good-programmer-is-perceptive">9. A Good Programmer is perceptive</h4>

<p>Your understanding of the code and its behavior is based
upon observation.</p>

<p>In order to understand the code or problems with the code,
it is necessary to take note of the relevant details and
collect more information as needed.</p>

<h4 id="10-a-good-programmer-is-selective">10. A Good Programmer is selective</h4>

<p>More importantly, you should be wary of considering
irrelevant information and invalid solutions.</p>

<p>It is easier to reason about code when you are not bogged
down with superfluous information and constructs.</p>

<h4 id="11-a-good-programmer-fixes-high-level-issues-first">11. A Good Programmer fixes high-level issues first</h4>

<p>Problems should be prioritized by their scope.</p>

<p>Lower-level problems are irrelevant if a wider issue
exists. Fixing high-level problems lead to a greater
overall benefit for the code.</p>

<h4 id="12-a-good-programmer-selects-the-correct-tools">12. A Good Programmer selects the correct tools</h4>

<p>You should know when and where to apply different methods
and techniques.</p>

<p>The right tools make it easier to write good code. Good
Programmers avoid using the wrong tools because they cause
issues.</p>

<h4 id="13-a-good-programmer-is-capable-of-cost-benefit-analysis">13. A Good Programmer is capable of cost-benefit analysis</h4>

<p>No solution is free of flaws.</p>

<p>You should be able to evaluate and justify why the benefits
of using one solution outweigh its costs and the benefits
of the solutions you did not use.</p>

<h4 id="14-a-good-programmer-sees-the-bigger-picture">14. A Good Programmer sees the bigger picture</h4>

<p>Your code does not exist in a vacuum.</p>

<p>You should be able to understand the surrounding context.
A Good Programmer puts their decisions and their code into
perspective.</p>

<h4 id="15-a-good-programmer-engineers-solutions">15. A Good Programmer engineers solutions</h4>

<p>The engineering process is an effective way of solving
problems.</p>

<p>You should be able to make realistic assumptions, design
prototypes, test and verify your solutions and iterate.</p>

<h4 id="16-a-good-programmer-builds-off-their-experiences">16. A Good Programmer builds off their experiences</h4>

<p>Your experiences are your greatest asset.</p>

<p>A Good Programmer uses their experiences to inform their
decisions.</p>

<h4 id="17-a-good-programmer-sees-opportunities-to-learn-and-grow">17. A Good Programmer sees opportunities to learn and grow</h4>

<p>You should be open to adding new experiences and adapting
yourself to critique.</p>

<p>A Good Programmer is never satisfied with their own level
of knowledge. They continually seek further knowledge and
feedback.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>These precepts are not all that make a Good Programmer.
Learning how to apply these precepts requires experience,
and most importantly, time.</p>

<p>These are only some of the examples of what many novice
developers commonly miss, but it is not an exhaustive list.
Luckily, it was never meant to be.</p>

<p>Keep these at the back of your mind. Take a look at it
every once in a while. You have already started on the path
to becoming a Good Programmer just by thinking beyond just
the code itself.</p>
