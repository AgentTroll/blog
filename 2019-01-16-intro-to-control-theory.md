While I don't profess to be an absolute expert at control theory, a lot of the information about the matter
that I've found online appears to be either inaccessible to the average Joe or unhelpful. I've decided to
do a write up about what control theory is from the perspective of an implementor, rather than a theorist.

That being said, control theory is still theory. That is, to understand the concept itself, you must
understand the theory. I do plan on going over the practical use of control theory in code later on in this
post, but I will first begin with theory.

Feel free to drop me a message on Telegram if I've made any errors in my explanation, because I again do not
profess to be an expert at all in the subject.
