  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Hello! I’m AgentTroll, some people might know me as xTrollxDudex, AgentTrolldude, PierreC, or by any of the various other internet aliases that might point here.</p>

<p>For those who don’t know, I’m fully Vietnamese, although born in America. I speak Vietnamese, English, and French.</p>

<p>I’m currently 17 years old and a high school sophomore. Academically, I love STEM subjects (especially math and physics) as well as world history. I live in Seattle, Washington, USA. If you’re reading this, you probably clicked on something that I have done programming/development related.</p>

<p>I’ve been working with Java since 2012 (according to GitHub) and have a lot of experience with the language. In particular, my specialties include working with performance sensitive code and multithreaded applications. I suck at swing and front end development.</p>

<p>I also happen to know bits and pieces of HTML/CSS/JavaScript as well as C/C++ (the code to the latter applications I have never published however).</p>

<p>I’m very passionate about open source software and technical writing. I’m horrible at writing analysis papers, but I love writing about Java and how &amp; why I do particular things in the code that I write. I also love Linux, in particular my Debian Jessie computer using XFCE4 as its DM. I’m also starting to gain interest in cryptography and infosec, which I’m trying to use significantly more.</p>

<p>I aspect about computing I love is the mystery in it. In computing, whether it be the use of Linux or any of the languages that I know, I’m bound to hit a roadblock problem everyonce in a while. I find that the reserach and trying to debug, to test, and to solve problems is the most appealing part of writing programs or using computers. The more challenging the bug was to find, the more satsifaction I meet when I finally figure out how to fix it, and then there’s things about programming that are artistic, elegant, or counterintuitive that makes every problem and solution unique in its own way.</p>

<p>My main game is Team Fortress 2, one that I’ve played for around 2500 hours.</p>

<p>Apart from my nerd life, I’ve played soccer for 6 years, 3 of which in premier. I’ve played centerback for the most part, although I’m moving more to leftback in the recent years. I’m a fan of Manchester City, Borussia Dortmund, and Olympique Marseille. I used to run cross country for my middle school, although I don’t anymore despite reaching my peak at 2nd in districts.</p>

<p>My best tip for learning Java, or anything for that matter: Try to teach someone else how to do something and don’t afraid to be wrong about what you say.</p>

<p>If you want to talk, I can be reached at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>My email, <code class="highlighter-rouge">woodyc40@gmail.com</code></li>
  <li>My keybase, <code class="highlighter-rouge">agenttroll</code></li>
</ul>

<p>I do not use any social medias or chat services too often, however you will usually see me frequent Telegram <code class="highlighter-rouge">@AgentTroll</code>.</p>

<p>I do not usually accept steam friend requests unless I know you very well.</p>
