    <p>This post should come with a big red disclaimer that says
I’m not an expert, but since my screen is redshifted to
hell, plain black will have to do. I’m just a Java
programmer with a blog.</p>

<p>With that out of the way, I am subscribed to
<a href="https://t.me/hackernewslive">Hacker News Live</a> channel,
which posts updates regarding Google Chrome a few times,
every time with dozens of thumbs-ups and only a few
thumbs-down votes. A few weeks ago, I decided to just check
<a href="https://www.siliconvalley.com/2019/06/21/google-chrome-has-become-surveillance-software-its-time-to-switch/">the link</a>,
which I found to be an interesting read indeed. It’s not
everyday you see almost 20 thumbs-ups on a single article
on the Hacker News Live channel, so there must either be a
really compelling point made or there are anti-Google bots
on the channel.</p>

<p>That was the beginning of a pretty long journey.</p>

<h1 id="why-privacy-is-important">Why Privacy is Important</h1>

<p>If you don’t think privacy is important, then I doubt
anything I say will change your mind. That being said, I
think that it is a topic worth being informed on. I’m not
an expert on this subject, but there are plenty of people
who are and can convince you of the importance of privacy
if I fail to do so. I’ll be sure to give links.</p>

<p>I wrote this
<a href="https://twitter.com/AgentTrolldude/status/1154623948039962625">tweet</a>
a few days ago. The first link of course, is to the
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_to_hide_argument">Nothing to hide</a>”
argument. The reasoning goes that if you have nothing to
hide, then you have nothing to fear. You can allow for
your privacy to be violated because you don’t care about
what people are going to find. This is far and away the
most common counterpoint I tend to hear about why people
shouldn’t care about privacy. This is a vastly flawed
argument in a number of ways. There are a lot of details
on the Wikipedia page I linked, but you can find further
information here:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/wiki/index#wiki_why_should_i_care_about_privacy.3F">r/privacy Wiki</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.privacytools.io/">privacytoolsIO Main page</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The links above are a fantastic starting place to learn
more about privacy and why you should care. I’ll even
talk about why I care about privacy myself later on. But
first, I’ll get back to why “having nothing to hide” is a
terrible argument. First of all, it is overly presumptuous
and implies that only criminals should expect privacy. It
implies that law-abiding citizens should not be afraid of
having their personal information exposed, because no harm
can come to them if they can prove that they are completely
innocent. However, even if you don’t have anything to hide,
“<a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/secrecy/you-may-have-nothing-hide-you-still-have-something-fear">you still have something to fear</a>.”
If you did not care about your personal information, would
you be comfortable with someone using your identity to
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/3hynvp/how_do_you_counter_the_i_have_nothing_to_hide/">commit a crime</a>?
Would you let someone in to your bathroom to watch you
shower and use the toilet? Would you invite people passing
by to watch you sleep? Having nothing to hide is a poor
argument for not caring about privacy. The truth is, you
probably do have something to hide. You are not
infalliable. If you have nothing to hide, you probably need
to look harder. And even then, you <em>should not have
something to hide in order to expect privacy</em>. You expect
privacy when you are using the bathroom or spending time
with your family. It would be creepy to have someone
staring through your window, watching your every move. But
you don’t have to take my word for it, there are lots of
arguments for and against having anything to hide and
whether that entitles you to privacy. Let’s keep moving.</p>

<p>According to the linked r/privacy wiki:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>there is an ever increasing portion of our lives which is
being recorded by corporations and governments, and these
records can be used to our disadvantage, at any time, now
or any-time in the future</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Corporations and governments have an immense amount of
power armed with the data they have collected from users
and citizens. If you do have something to hide (which you
almost certainly do, otherwise, do not ever lock your doors
again), the question now becomes can they be accountable
for that data. I believe I read an article which I’m
currently unable to find about how Google’s reCAPTCHA v3
technology could even be used to detect Parkinsons based
on the movement of a user’s mouse. This is a fantastic way
to inform people who may not have been diagnosed yet. But
on the other hand, this information may also be
inadvertently published, for example, to insurance
companies who will raise your premiums. Even if Google
never ends up doing this, deducing health conditions based
simply on mouse movements is a testament to the data
collection power of Internet corporations. Even if Google
cannot collect this data, someone else may exploit this
technology themselves. Even if you don’t care if your rates
increase, even if you don’t care if everybody in the whole
world knew you had Parkinsons, it isn’t like it would help
you to be in that situation. <em>Even if it did help</em>, it
might hurt others. Even if companies and governments are
good stewards of your data, assuming that no nefarious
employees access that data, assuming that no one is able to
read your data when you are sending it, assuming that there
is “no one out to get you,” and assuming a plethora of
other unrealistic expectations about how your data is
handled, privacy still matters to you. The mere fact that
you do not care about your privacy is an expoitable data
point, because you be expected to give up your data
needlessly. And this is in the best possible scenario.
In reality, companies profit off of collecting and selling
data. Allowing yourself to be complacent is like putting
your wallet with all of your cash on the ground. Some
people will try to find to owner or report it to police,
but others are going to make a profit. Even if you do not
value your own personal information, <em>someone else will</em>.
Your data cannot help you if the government has access to
both exculpatory information and incriminating information
if their sole goal is to arrest you. It doesn’t matter if
you have not committed a crime and it doesn’t matter that
you have nothing to hide.</p>

<p>All of this is not to say that your information has been
or will be used against you. Only that it may be, and that
it is a very real threat. You may not be impacted yourself,
but others already have. Look no further than the
totalitarian governments. If you think that you don’t have
anything to hide, think again, because chances are, you
probably do.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-case-against-online-privacy/">One article</a>
claims that services that collect data
“provide […] some value.” Let’s say that you aren’t like
me and you do care about ads. You think that being tracked,
having your preferences recorded, and having a slower
browser is a good thing because you benefit in the end.
But the argument is severely flawed. The author
subsequently points fingers at ISPs since they allegedly
don’t provide you a better service, they give data to
the cops, and they don’t tell you you are being tracked.
These are all debunked by Facebook’s
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/policy.php">Data Policy</a>,
which states that they also comply with law enforcement,
and by Comcast’s
<a href="https://www.xfinity.com/corporate/customers/policies/customerprivacy#to-provide-and-improve-the-services">Customer Privacy Notice</a>,
which literally says that they collect traffic and use
the data they collect to improve their services. I’m sure
other ISPs will have similar policies. But never mind that
fact, the whole point is that there still is value to be
gained from expectation of privacy, even if you think you
benefit from not having that expectation. Again, just
because the data isn’t being abused right now doesn’t mean
it won’t be in the future (on the other hand, as I keep
saying, it doesn’t mean that it <em>will</em> either). The data
and the conclusions that can be drawn from it are powerful
bargaining tools if they reveal information that you don’t
want people to know. But let’s say that you don’t care.
That does not mean that you shouldn’t be entitled to be
able to control the data advertising companies collect.
Like I will describe in the reasons why I personally care
about privacy, I state that it is about controlling my
information. If you do not care about your information,
you are implicitly allowing for that information to be
released about yourself. So although you don’t care about
the data being collected itself, you do care about
controlling it. Even if you don’t do anything to hide
that data in the first place, your lack of control is in
of itself your decision. You should have the option halt
the collection of data if that is your choice as well.
Allowing your personal data to be collected is as much of
a decision based on your privacy preference as is not
allowing it to be.</p>

<p>There are so many more points and counterpoints that I can’t
list them all here. Instead, I’ll leave more links so you
can read them yourself.</p>

</ul>

<h4 id="why-i-care">Why I Care</h4>

<p>I myself have my own personal reasons to care about
privacy.</p>

<p>In no particular order, I care about my privacy because I
think that it is important for me to control my personal
information. For example, the front page of my GitHub
profile has my name right on it, but it’s not like I go
around on public forums announcing my name. This is a
deliberate choice. While I’m not keeping my identity
private, I think an important part of privacy is the
element of control. I’m not preventing anyone from finding
out who I am, because I post plenty of that information on
the web. If people are curious, they can find out more
about me. There are going to be creeps online of course,
but from my own personal experience, I feel that having
this information in public has benefitted me much more than
it has been a detriment. It has helped me connect with
people on more than one occaision. But you may be curious,
how does controlling my data relate to privacy? Here is
what the
<a href="https://iapp.org/about/what-is-privacy/">IAPP</a> has to say
on that matter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Broadly speaking, privacy is the right to be let alone,
or freedom from interference or intrusion. Information
privacy is the right to have some control over how your
personal information is collected and used.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By making my information less visible in some contexts and
more so in others, I am controlling my privacy. However,
in other contexts, that could also mean hiding my
information more or less completely. For example, I share
my Discord information with very few people, same deal with
my Steam account. I don’t share my passwords with anyone.
Privacy doesn’t mean that you explicitly need to hide
anything, only that you are in control of information.</p>

<p>Secondly, I care about my privacy because I think that some
of my information shouldn’t fall into the hands of hackers.
Online accounts often link information such as birthdate,
phone number, friendships, etc. Many companies have privacy
policies that say that your information is encrypted or
stored safely and all of that. However, the IAPP states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While security is necessary for protecting data, it’s not
sufficient for addressing privacy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And they’re right. There are many examples of this being
exhibited in the real world, such as in the case of
<a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/09/security-update/">Facebook</a>
just last year. The truth is, once you give your data to
a company, it is stored inside of a black box. I don’t
want to sound like a consspiracy theorist or anything,
but I don’t want my data to be in the hands of someone
I don’t know, running software that might have
vulnerabilities, or servers that are behind on security
updates. I expect that companies I give my personal
information to protect that information. Even companies
proclaim themselves to
<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/firefox-data-privacy-promise/">protect your privacy</a>
make
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/anxfz8/firefox_is_spyware_extension_recommendation/eg1hekf/">mistakes</a>
as well. (See the comments, the post is entirely outrage
bait and tinfoil hattery).</p>

<p>The simple fact is, I personally don’t see why companies
should have access to data that they don’t need. I don’t
care if they encrypt it, I don’t care if it is anonymized
or if they never sell it, or if they don’t even have it
stored in the first place. Why am I sending this data then?
That would be analogous to going out to lunch and then
suddenly announcing to people that I have bowel issues. Not
only would this be completely inappropriate, the
information I’m giving is completely unecessary because I’m
going to eat, not going to the doctor. To apply this to a
browser for example, why is Google Chrome sending
information back to Google when my browser would work
completely fine without that data sent anywhere? I don’t
care what is being sent, why is it even sent in the first
place?</p>

<p>Finally, I personally care about my privacy because
tracking takes up my computer’s resources. Loading ads
and spyware implanted on websites that are designed to
track you takes up CPU, RAM, and battery power. If I’m on
a slow WiFi connection, I want every little bit of
bandwidth to load the fucking website, not a bunch of ads.
I’d be happy to donate my money to subscription-based
services such as reputable news sites and content creators
if it means getting rid of ads and they get 100% of the
revenue. Nevermind the fact that advertising companies
want to collect every bit of data possible about me to
“tailor” their ads, I literally just don’t want my battery
to be drained any faster than it already is by being
tracked.</p>

<h1 id="what-you-can-do">What You Can Do</h1>

<p>I will warn you before this that when regarding privacy,
many of the sources that you’ll run into are not shy about
coming off as tinfoil hatters. I’ve found sources that run
articles about the fall of capitalism, the end of the
world, etc., which can be expected of people who tend to be
paranoid, if not overly so at times. However, privacy and
security are real issues that governments are interested in
as well, and I advise that you ignore the more extreme
conspiracy theorizing and select the portions of the
articles that are rational, or the ones that match your
own
<a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/your-security-plan">threat profile</a>.</p>

<p>Again, I will reference the r/privacy wiki that I linked
early in this blog post. It has a lot of references to
many different tools to minimize or take control of the
data being collected on you.</p>

<p>I don’t give a comprehensive list here, but it should be
enough to give you an idea of my personal preferences and
where you can find more information. In general, if you
use any software or website that visits the Internet, you
should check on its Privacy Policy and look for informed
opinions about whether or not that service respects your
privacy.</p>

<h4 id="web-browser">Web Browser</h4>

<p>Another great resource is the
<a href="https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/browsers.html">Spyware Watchdog</a>,
with the linked page going to a comparison of different
web browsers. I personally use Ungoogled Chromium because
I prefer a Chromium based browser that had all of the
spyware disabled right out of the box. I have the following
extensions installed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bitwarden</li>
  <li>Cookie AutoDelete</li>
  <li>Decentraleyes</li>
  <li>EditThisCookie</li>
  <li>HTTPS Everywhere</li>
  <li>NoScript</li>
  <li>Privacy Badger</li>
  <li>uBlock Origin</li>
</ul>

<p>There are plethora of different extensions for Firefox as
well, but since I’ve moved on from using Firefox, I won’t
list them here. I personally prefer the UI on Chromium
and I liked not having to configure anything.</p>

<h4 id="os">OS</h4>

<p>If you are not using Linux, I highly recommend switching.
Since I already use Debian by default, I have little to say
on this matter. You should read up
<a href="https://www.privacytools.io/operating-systems/#os">here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="search-engine">Search Engine</h4>

<p>I personally use StartPage. I’ve used DuckDuckGo in the
past but I’ve personally found StartPage to be a lot better
in terms of search results. Your milage may vary. Again,
see
<a href="https://www.privacytools.io/providers/search-engines/">privacytoolsIO</a>
for more alternatives.</p>

<h4 id="deleting-accounts">Deleting Accounts</h4>

<p>Before writing this article, I had hundreds of logins. I’ve
sent dozens and dozens of emails to the different sites
that I’ve had accounts on asking for them to delete accounts
I no longer use. Before deleting your account, you should
try to obfuscate some of your personal data if you see fit.
You can read each website’s privacy policies if you don’t
know who to contact to delete your account. Deleting your
account means that the data is (hopefully) removed from
the service provider’s servers, and you will (hopefully)
reduce the size of your digital footprint. You can reduce
the chance of having an account compromised if you don’t
have as many accounts.</p>

<h4 id="spread-the-word">Spread the Word</h4>

<p>If you’ve made it this far, you probably at least care
about privacy enough to think that it is an issue worth
promoting. Tell your friends, advise them to move away
from using services that track users and services that do
not respect their users’ privacy. Privacy is an issue of
complacency. It is easy to have your rights taken away and
your freedoms to be violated if you never knew you had them
in the first place. At worst, at least people will be more
informed if they do not choose to control their personal
data.</p>

<p>These are only some of the ways that I’ve tried to control
my data and my privacy. There are of course, many more
ways to improve even what I’ve listed here, and there are
other services that are worth giving up that the reader
might be using that I don’t know of. Evaluate what your
risk profile is, minimize your digital footprint, and
assert your right to privacy.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Obviously, this isn’t a programming-related post, but I
still hope that you’ve learned something nevertheless.
Privacy is not only about the here and now, but also about
the future. Now that we are hearing more and more of the
media publicizing hacks for political gain such as the
Clinton email leak and the Cambridge Analytica scandal, it
is more important than ever to take a hard look at how much
we really value our privacy, and by extension, how much we
value our democracy. Privacy is obviously a controversial
issue because it is so politically charged, but I’ve tried
my best to try to stay neutral on this matter. I don’t
think it matters what political party you subscribe to, or
how much you think you care about your privacy, it is an
important issue in the digital age.</p>
